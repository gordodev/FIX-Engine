# FIX Protocol Experiments

This repository serves as my experimental workspace for exploring FIX (Financial Information eXchange) protocol concepts. The code here represents learning exercises and technical experiments rather than production-ready implementations.

## Purpose

- Personal learning and experimentation with FIX protocol
- Testing socket programming concepts for financial applications
- Exploring message parsing and handling techniques

## Note to Visitors

This code is not intended for production use. It represents my journey learning about financial protocols and may contain incomplete or experimental implementations. For production-ready FIX implementations, please refer to established libraries like QuickFIX.

## Technologies Explored

- Python socket programming
- FIX protocol message structure
- Financial message parsing techniques
